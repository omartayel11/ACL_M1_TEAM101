Since the user is focused on cleanliness, 8.8 is a solid score, though not the highest possible.\n\nThen there's Canal House Grand in Amsterdam.

So I'll present the Paris option first and note the other one as a side note if allowed. Wait, the instructions say to base the answer strictly on the context. The context includes both hotels but the user wants Paris. So the main answer is L'Étoile Palace. The other hotel is in Amsterdam, so maybe mention it briefly as a comparison but clarify it's not in Paris. The user might find that info useful for context. Let me check the instructions again: \"If the context doesn't contain enough information, say so.\" Here, the context does have info on a Paris hotel with good cleanliness.
