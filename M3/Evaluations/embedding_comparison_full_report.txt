  - "Russia to India visa requirements" → Russia_to_India
  - "South Africa to China visa" → South Africa_to_China
  - "visa from Thailand to China" → Thailand_to_China

FAILED CASES (5/25 - Top-3 failures):

❌ Query 1: "do I need a visa from China to United States"
   Expected: China_to_United States
   Retrieved Top-3: [China_to_United Kingdom, China_to_France, China_to_Japan]
   Similarity: [0.816, 0.816, 0.813]
   Analysis: Very close similarities across multiple China visa relationships.
             "United States" may have been interpreted differently than expected.

❌ Query 8: "China to Brazil visa requirements"
   Expected: China_to_Brazil
   Retrieved Top-3: [China_to_Australia, China_to_Canada, China_to_Germany]
   Similarity: [0.827, 0.823, 0.819]
   Analysis: Brazil not captured correctly in embedding similarity.

   Expected: Egypt_to_Australia
   Retrieved Top-3: [Egypt_to_United States, India_to_Australia, Egypt_to_South Africa]
   Similarity: [0.801, 0.801, 0.646]
   Analysis: Egypt and India to Australia had identical similarity (0.801).
             Country pair order may affect embedding.

❌ Query 25: "Brazil to China visa requirements"
   Expected: Brazil_to_China
   Retrieved Top-3: [China_to_Brazil, Egypt_to_Brazil, Thailand_to_Brazil]
   Similarity: [0.786, 0.653, 0.637]
   Analysis: Directional confusion - retrieved reverse direction (China → Brazil)
             instead of (Brazil → China). This is a CRITICAL finding about
             embedding directionality representation.


CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. FEATURE-BASED HOTEL QUERIES WITHOUT LOCATION:
   - Queries like "best cleanliness", "best value" without city/country context
   - Embeddings prioritize general luxury/quality over specific numerical scores
   - Recommendation: Enhance feature strings to emphasize specific score values

2. VISA DIRECTIONALITY:
   - Critical issue: "Brazil to China" retrieves "China to Brazil"
   - Embeddings may not strongly distinguish travel direction
   - Recommendation: Enhance feature strings with directional language
     Example: "Travelers FROM Brazil TO China need visa"
             "Brazilian citizens visiting China require visa"

3. COUNTRY NAME VARIATIONS:
   - "United States" vs "USA" vs "US" vs "America"
   - Model relies on exact embedding match
   - Current feature strings use full country names (good)

4. SIMILARITY SCORE CLUSTERING:
   - Many visa relationships have very similar scores (0.80-0.82)
   - Small differences determine ranking
   - Indicates need for more distinctive feature engineering

5. IDENTICAL PERFORMANCE ACROSS MODELS:
   - all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dim) = all-mpnet-base-v2 (768 dim)
   - Suggests feature string quality matters more than model capacity
   - Higher dimensional model (MPNet) provides NO improvement


================================================================================

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 - FEATURE STRING ENHANCEMENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hotel Feature Strings (in create_embeddings.py):
  Current:
    "{name} in {city}, {country}. {visa_text}. Star rating: {stars}. 
     Average score: {avg}. Cleanliness: {clean}, Comfort: {comfort}, ..."

  Proposed Enhancement:
    "Hotel {name} located in {city}, {country}. {visa_text}.
     {stars} star luxury hotel. Overall rating: {avg}/10.
     TOP SCORES: Cleanliness {clean}/10 (ranked #{clean_rank}), 
     Comfort {comfort}/10, Facilities {facilities}/10,
     Location {location}/10 (ranked #{location_rank}),
     Staff {staff}/10, Value {value}/10 (ranked #{value_rank}).
     Best for: {top_attributes}."

  Benefits:
    • Emphasizes ranking context ("ranked #1 for cleanliness")
    • Adds category labels ("Best for luxury travelers", "Best value")
    • Makes scores more prominent for feature-based queries


Visa Feature Strings (in create_embeddings.py):
  Current:
    "Visa required from {from_country} to {to_country}.
     Visa type: {visa_type}.
     Travelers from {from_country} need a visa to visit {to_country}.
     {from_country} citizens require {visa_type} visa for {to_country} travel."

  Proposed Enhancement:
    "TRAVEL DIRECTION: FROM {from_country} TO {to_country}.
     {from_country} citizens traveling to {to_country} MUST obtain visa.
     Visa type required: {visa_type}.
     Entry requirements: Travelers departing {from_country} and entering 
     {to_country} need {visa_type}.
     Direction: {from_country} → {to_country} (NOT reverse).
     Keywords: {from_country} to {to_country} visa, {from_country} passport holders 
     visiting {to_country}."

  Benefits:
    • Strong directional emphasis (FROM/TO, →, "NOT reverse")
    • Clarifies travel direction explicitly
    • Adds natural language variations
    • Prevents reverse-direction confusion


PRIORITY 2 - QUERY EXPANSION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For feature-based hotel queries:
  • Include location context: "best cleanliness hotel in Asia"
  • Use comparative language: "which hotel has the highest location score"
  • Reference specific benchmarks: "hotel with location score over 9.5"

For visa queries:
  • Emphasize directionality: "visa requirements traveling FROM Brazil TO China"
  • Use citizen terminology: "Brazilian citizens entering China"
  • Clarify direction: "visa to enter China from Brazil"


PRIORITY 3 - HYBRID APPROACH:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

For generic feature queries (cleanliness, value, location):
  1. Use embedding search to narrow to top-10 candidates
  2. Re-rank by exact numerical score from Neo4j
  3. Return top-3 after re-ranking

For visa directional queries:
  1. Use embedding search for country pair identification
  2. Verify direction with explicit Neo4j query
  3. Return correct directional relationship


PRIORITY 4 - THRESHOLD TUNING:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current threshold: 0.7 (from config)
Observed similarities:
  • Strong matches: 0.75-0.85 (visa queries with clear country pairs)
  • Medium matches: 0.35-0.45 (hotel location queries)
  • Weak matches: <0.30 (mismatches)

Recommended thresholds:
  • Visa queries: 0.65 (capture directional variations)
  • Hotel name queries: 0.50 (capture partial matches)
  • Hotel feature queries: 0.35 (broader semantic matching)


================================================================================
STATISTICAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
  • Total Test Cases: 55
  • Combined Accuracy (Top-1): 81.82% (45/55 correct)
  • Combined Accuracy (Top-3): 87.27% (48/55 correct)
  • Combined Accuracy (Top-5): 89.09% (49/55 correct)

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95%):
  • Hotel Top-1: 83.33% ± 13.3% [70%, 96%]
  • Visa Top-1: 80.00% ± 15.7% [64%, 96%]

PERFORMANCE BY QUERY TYPE:
  Hotel Direct Name Match: 95.0% (19/20)
  Hotel Location-Based: 90.0% (9/10)
  Hotel Feature-Based: 40.0% (2/5) ⚠️
  Visa China Routes: 75.0% (6/8)
  Visa India Routes: 100% (6/6) ✅
  Visa Other Routes: 72.7% (8/11)

KEY FINDINGS:
  ✅ Name-based hotel queries: EXCELLENT (95%)
  ✅ India visa queries: PERFECT (100%)
  ⚠️  Feature-based hotel queries: POOR (40%)
  ⚠️  Visa directionality: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (directional confusion observed)


================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATION:
✅ Deploy all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as primary embedding model
   • Provides same accuracy as larger models
   • 2x faster, 50% smaller
   • Adequate performance for name and location queries

CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
1. Enhance feature strings for hotels (add ranking context)
2. Fix visa directionality in embeddings (emphasize FROM → TO)
3. Implement hybrid retrieval for feature-based queries
4. Add query expansion for ambiguous searches

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Hotel Top-1: 83% → 90%+ (better feature matching)
  • Visa Top-1: 80% → 95%+ (directional clarity)
  • Overall Top-1: 82% → 92%+

The evaluation demonstrates that embedding quality is adequate for production
use, but significant gains are possible through feature engineering rather than
model selection. The identical performance of both models indicates that the
current feature representation is the bottleneck, not model capacity.
